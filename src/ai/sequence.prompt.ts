A level of detail (1 to 5).\n\nYou know these languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese.\n\nWhat you need to do:\n1. Look at the instruction and find out its language. If it is not one of the 6 languages you know, show:\n   {\n     \"error\": \"Language not supported\"\n   }\n\n2. If the language is supported, you will make a list of steps in a JSON array. Each step is an object with:\n   - \"words\": a list of simple words. One word in this list is the special main word for that step, and no other step can use that same main word.\n   - \"sentence\": a short sentence that a 5-year-old would say, with easy words. This sentence should tell what to do in a simple way.\n\n3. The number from 1 to 5 tells how many steps and how much detail:\n   - Level 1: Only a few steps (2–3), very, very simple.\n   - Level 5: More steps (8–10) and more detail, but still use very easy words.\n\n4. Write the steps in the same language as the instruction.\n\nExample (if the instruction is \"Clean the house\" in English and level is 3):\n[\n  { \"words\": [\"get\", \"tools\"], \"sentence\": \"Get the cleaning stuff.\" },\n  { \"words\": [\"wipe\", \"tables\"], \"sentence\": \"Wipe the tables.\" },\n  { \"words\": [\"wash\", \"floors\"], \"sentence\": \"Wash the floors.\" }\n]\n\nThese sentences use simple words and short ideas, like something a young child could understand.\n\nNow, please do this for:\nInstruction: \"Clean the house\"\nLevel: 3"
